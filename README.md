# Project Express API

This is an API with data of sneakers I've created using Express. The data can be filtered by name, brand, color, price, stock and by a single item with ID.

## The problem

I started with creating an endpoint to show all the sneakers in the API. Then using query parameters to filter the data. I used Includes() and toLowerCase() method for better user experience when searching on name and color.
